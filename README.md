# Basic API app

This is my first attempt at a JavaScript App. Made as part of the Career Foundry Full Stack Dev program, this application serves as a digital encyclopedia of pokémon. In connects to an external Pokémon API and displays data about each object. In addition to this users are able to filter through the list of returned objects by searching by name for a pokémon.
